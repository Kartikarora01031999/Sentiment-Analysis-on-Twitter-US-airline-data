positive," @ABCNetwork please give JetBlue all the permissions in the world! I'm missing the oscars right now, and it's awful #whyabcwhy"
negative, Thanks. So the delay was the result of scheduling issues more than weather reLate Flightd problems?
neutral," @shannonwoodward I'll be checking often. Most probably when they hand the oscars out to the nerds, geeks and badly dressed."
negative, I am less concerned about the delay than I am about not being notified until I looked at the board that my flight was delayed

negative," And also, it's great that you tweet @ complainers, but what about the in-person help when I need it? Robyn F. in Manch = useless."

negative, we should have been given the option to get off the plane not sit on it for a time longer than our actually flight.
